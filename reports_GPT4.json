    "description": "GDP growth in Brazil has been remarkably resilient over the past three years\nand, as expected, is showing signs of moderation. The expansion has reflected strong\nconsumption supported by fiscal stimulus on the demand side, and supply-side factors.\nInflation rebounded in 2024 amid strong demand, a rise in food prices, and currency\ndepreciation. As inflation expectations rose above the target tolerance interval,\nmonetary policy entered a new policy tightening cycle in September. Long-standing\nchallenges remain, including elevated public debt and spending rigidities that crowd\nout priority investments. The authorities have made progress on reforms to foster\nsustainable and inclusive growth, including implementation of VAT reform.",

The authorities’ policy actions\nin the first year of the program have yielded strong results. The transition towards a\nflexible exchange rate regime has proceeded with little disruption. Measures to\nmodernize monetary policy, mobilize domestic revenues, enhance social safety nets,\nstrengthen SOEs, and anchor financial stability continue to show encouraging results.\nMaintaining reform momentum will be important to consolidate gains and support\ngrowth and poverty reduction in the medium term.",

    "description": "Benin’s strong institutional foundation and economic reform drive, combined\nwith sound macroeconomic management, has generated tangible dividends. Economic\nactivity accelerated over the past five years—and markedly in 2024—with promising\nsigns of economic transformation and less volatile income growth. Fiscal consolidation\nin 2024 supported Benin’s convergence to the WAEMU deficit norm of 3 percent of\nGDP one year in advance—one of only two countries to do so in the WAEMU. The 2025\nbudget will therefore target a minor adjustment to remain in compliance with the\nWAEMU deficit norm. The strong reform drive has sustained development partners’\nengagement and reaffirmed international investors’ confidence: budget support\ncontinues to consistently exceed expectations, while access to international markets is\nmarked by successful issuances. Going forward, Benin will need to manage sociopolitical\nand security challenges, while maintaining the reform and tax collection\nmomentum and strengthening inclusive policies to entrench the ongoing economic\ntransformation.",
