    "description": "GDP growth in Brazil has been remarkably resilient over the past three years\nand, as expected, is showing signs of moderation. The expansion has reflected strong\nconsumption supported by fiscal stimulus on the demand side, and supply-side factors.\nInflation rebounded in 2024 amid strong demand, a rise in food prices, and currency\ndepreciation. As inflation expectations rose above the target tolerance interval,\nmonetary policy entered a new policy tightening cycle in September. Long-standing\nchallenges remain, including elevated public debt and spending rigidities that crowd\nout priority investments. The authorities have made progress on reforms to foster\nsustainable and inclusive growth, including implementation of VAT reform.",

[pp. 2, 3]  **2.1 Consumption taxes/VAT/Income tax/Wealth tax/Corporate tax**  The article references income tax reforms as part of the broader revenue mobilisation strategy. The focus is on broadening the tax base and enhancing tax administration to increase government revenues. [pp. 3]  **2.2 Tax Expenditures and Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs)**  The need to implement the National Medium-Term Revenue Strategy is mentioned, highlighting the importance of addressing challenges such as Ethiopia\u2019s low tax-to-GDP ratio and declining ODA. [pp. 3]  **4.3 Distributional impacts/social impacts**  The article mentions the need to strengthen social safety nets while phasing out fuel subsidies. This indicates a consideration of the distributional effects of the reforms, aiming to protect vulnerable groups from potential negative impacts. [pp. 2, 3]  **5.1 Social protection/Social safety net/ targeting/ targeted/ registry/ies**  Enhancing social safety nets is discussed as a measure to mitigate the potential negative impacts of phasing out fuel subsidies. This indicates a focus on targeted transfers to protect the most vulnerable populations. [pp. 2, 3]  **6. Private and external sector**  The overall economic reform agenda is geared towards creating a more favourable environment for investment and promoting private sector-led growth. This involves various measures to improve the external sector and attract foreign direct investment. [pp. 2, 3]  **6.1 External sector/business-friendly environment and FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)**  The article discusses the importance of improving the FX market functioning and exchange rate reform to attract foreign direct investment and boost export growth. These measures aim to create a business-friendly environment conducive to private sector-led growth. [pp. 2, 3]  **6.3 Foreign Currency Debt and External Vulnerabilities**  The authorities are taking steps to secure a debt treatment to restore debt sustainability. The article emphasizes the importance of continued avoidance of non-concessional borrowing to contain debt vulnerabilities. The discussion also acknowledges the need to address external financing pressures. [pp. 2, 3]  **9.1 Governance/legal reforms**  The article mentions the implementation of the reformed legal framework for the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), including filling vacant NBE Board positions. This is intended to strengthen the NBE's autonomy and support its policy mandate, contributing to improved governance. Efforts to strengthen governance, enhance transparency, and reinforce the AML/CFT framework are seen as critical to improve the business climate and investors\u2019 confidence. [pp. 3]"

      "summary": "The Article IV report on Togo emphasises the need for fiscal consolidation to strengthen debt sustainability, while acknowledging the challenges posed by security threats and the need to maintain growth and inclusion. The report commends the authorities' efforts to mobilise tax revenue and recommends further enhancements to revenue collection and efficiency, including a medium-term revenue mobilisation strategy. Strengthening governance and the business environment are deemed critical for sustainable growth, with the authorities' commitment to publishing a Governance Diagnostic Assessment being welcomed, alongside aligning asset and income declaration regimes with international standards.  ---  **All Identified Themes**  1.

[p. 2]  1.  **Fiscal discipline/Fiscal consolidation/Fiscal sustainability/Credible fiscal frameworks/Fiscal constraint/adjustment/cuts** The document focuses on the need for Togo to undertake fiscal consolidation to ensure debt sustainability, balancing this with the need to maintain security, enhance inclusion, and support growth. There is reference to a limited relaxation of the fiscal deficit target for 2024, and delaying the goal of lowering the present value of debt below 55 percent of GDP. [p. 2] 2.  **Subsidies** The report advocates for phasing out fuel subsidies as part of broader efforts to improve spending efficiency and strengthen the social safety net. [p. 2] 2.  **Tax** The report commends the authorities for raising tax revenue and encourages continued efforts to enhance revenue while making taxation more efficient. It supports the timely elaboration of a medium-term revenue mobilisation strategy. [p. 2]  1.  **Consumption taxes/VAT/Income tax/Wealth tax/Corporate tax** The document mentions the need to enhance revenue and make taxation more efficient, which implicitly refers to the different types of taxes that could be leveraged, such as income tax, corporate tax, and VAT. [p. 2] 3.  **Climate and environment** The report notes the growing risks from climate change as a challenge that Togo faces.

[p. 6] 4.  **Social Services** The report mentions strengthening the effectiveness of the social safety net as an important measure, implying that the existing social services need improvement. [p. 2]  1.  **Social safety net/ targeting/ targeted/ registry/ies** The report emphasises the importance of strengthening the effectiveness of the social safety net, indicating a focus on better targeting and rationalisation of social assistance programs. [p. 2] 5.  **Private and external sector** The document refers to the need for nurturing the business environment to support sustainable growth, indicating a focus on the external sector and foreign direct investment. [p. 2]  1.  **External sector/business-friendly environment and FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)** The report states that strengthening governance will be critical for nurturing the business environment and supporting sustainable growth. [p. 2] 6.  **Governance** The report underscores the importance of strengthening governance for nurturing the business environment and supporting sustainable growth. The authorities' commitment to publishing the planned Governance Diagnostic Assessment is welcomed, and aligning asset and income declaration regimes with international standards is encouraged. [p. 2]  1.  **Governance/legal reforms** The report underscores the importance of strengthening governance, including legal frameworks and reforms, for nurturing the business environment and supporting sustainable growth. The authorities' commitment to publishing the planned Governance Diagnostic Assessment is welcomed, and aligning asset and income declaration regimes with international standards is encouraged.
