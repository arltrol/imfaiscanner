    "description": "GDP growth in Brazil has been remarkably resilient over the past three years\nand, as expected, is showing signs of moderation. The expansion has reflected strong\nconsumption supported by fiscal stimulus on the demand side, and supply-side factors.\nInflation rebounded in 2024 amid strong demand, a rise in food prices, and currency\ndepreciation. As inflation expectations rose above the target tolerance interval,\nmonetary policy entered a new policy tightening cycle in September. Long-standing\nchallenges remain, including elevated public debt and spending rigidities that crowd\nout priority investments. The authorities have made progress on reforms to foster\nsustainable and inclusive growth, including implementation of VAT reform.",

However, rapid expansion of spending and emerging financing constraints led to arrears accumulation in 2024. These challenges are now compounded by declining oil prices in a highly uncertain global environment, further aggravating fiscal and external sustainability risks. At the same time, the country is struggling with lingering structural economic challenges, including high unemployment, excessive state footprint, a weak banking sector, corruption, and an inefficient electricity sector.",

    "description": "Benin’s strong institutional foundation and economic reform drive, combined\nwith sound macroeconomic management, has generated tangible dividends. Economic\nactivity accelerated over the past five years—and markedly in 2024—with promising\nsigns of economic transformation and less volatile income growth. Fiscal consolidation\nin 2024 supported Benin’s convergence to the WAEMU deficit norm of 3 percent of\nGDP one year in advance—one of only two countries to do so in the WAEMU. The 2025\nbudget will therefore target a minor adjustment to remain in compliance with the\nWAEMU deficit norm. The strong reform drive has sustained development partners’\nengagement and reaffirmed international investors’ confidence: budget support\ncontinues to consistently exceed expectations, while access to international markets is\nmarked by successful issuances. Going forward, Benin will need to manage sociopolitical\nand security challenges, while maintaining the reform and tax collection\nmomentum and strengthening inclusive policies to entrench the ongoing economic\ntransformation.",
